Compile like any one file c++ program, run it like any program.
g++ solver hybridPresentation.cpp
./solver
Provide permutation of numbers from 0 to 15 for instance:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 0
program will decide if its solvable or not, if it is it will solve it like 15 puzzle.
If permutation is hard, it will take some time, but in most cases it is fast.
